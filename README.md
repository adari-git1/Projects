Resume Match Score with PySpark is an AI-driven pipeline that automates job description (JD) processing and resume analysis to provide accurate job fit scores. The project leverages AWS S3, Lambda, Apache Airflow, and NLP to optimize Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and enhance resume alignment with job postings.

Features

Automated JD Processing: Designed an NLP-driven pipeline that extracts and processes job descriptions via AWS S3, Lambda, and Apache Airflow, reducing manual effort by 80%.

AI-Based Matching Algorithm: Utilizes Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract key skills, experience, and role requirements from job descriptions and compare them with resumes to generate an accurate match score.

ATS Optimization & Notifications: Automatically delivers personalized job fit scores, missing skill insights, and keyword recommendations through email notifications, improving resume alignment with job postings.
